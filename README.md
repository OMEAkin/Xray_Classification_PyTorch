Task: Classification + FineTuning Deep Learning Model 

Pneumonia is one of the leading respiratory illnesses worldwide, and its timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Manually reviewing chest X-rays is a critical step in this process, and AI can provide valuable support by helping to expedite the assessment. 

By fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional neural network, specifically the ResNet-18 model, the task is to classify X-ray images into two categories: normal lungs and those affected by pneumonia.
